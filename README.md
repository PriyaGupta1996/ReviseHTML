Server: 
Where my web application / database etc is hosted. 

- HTTP:
A plain text language in which client and server  interact with each other

- https: encrypted 
- http forms a packet and sends to server and server tries to figure out what is it asking 
Request-- response.
- In response:
Html code may be â€¦ 
- Now when browser reads this html , it construts DOM(document object model). A model which represents Object / element in the html documents. 
Example: all the building blocks of the page 
- As soon as browser discovers references to other resources in the html it got. Like images font etc
- For all these resource there is an address or a URL , hence separate http requests are sent. Most of the times it is sent in parallel. 
Once it has all the necessary resources, it renders the html document. It means displaying it.
